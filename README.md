# PREDA Scale-out Smart Contracts Hackathon

## 👏🏻 Welcome to the Hackathon!
Welcome onboard! We're thrilled to introduce you to [**PREDA**](https://www.preda-lang.org/), a revolutionary programming model designed to scale out general smart contracts. This virtual hackathon is tailored for blockchain builders, developers, entrepreneurs, and anyone eager to supercharge the scalability of their DApps and protocols, harnessing the power of PREDA.

By participating in this event, you'll get your hands on powerful tools,  dive into the latest technology sharing, and receive wholehearted support from experts who know the ins and outs of programming with PREDA.

Beyond that, there's a chance for you to snatch a piece of the **10K USDT** reward pie, register for the hackathon now to secure a spot, and be part of this evolution!

## 📣 Introduce [PREDA](https://www.preda-lang.org/)
PREDA is a **novel programming model** for **scaling out any general smart contrac**t. This is achieved by partitioning the smart contract state and dividing the transaction traffic, which are jointly handled by multiple independent virtual machines that can be distributed and parallelized.

We implemented the PREDA model by **extending the Solidity language**, which demonstrates that popular smart contracts with different levels of complexity can be rewritten to gain scalability without taking care of the details of the underlying distributed system.

Check out [our PAPER](https://www.preda-lang.org/pdf/preda-model-sole.pdf) to delve further into PREDA, and how PREDA extends Solidity to achieve significant performance and scalability advantages.

## 📚 **Guidelines**
All developers and blockchain project teams are welcome to participate in the event. Projects are more likely to be accepted if they meet the following criteria:

- The code must be written with PREDA

> 💡 The project must utilize the [PREDA toolchain](https://www.preda-lang.org/) and can be successfully compiled with it.

- Participants can apply with existing projects or write new smart contracts using the PREDA programming model and programming language for the competition.
- Projects that make efficient use of **[PREDA core features](https://www.preda-lang.org/pdf/preda-model-sole.pdf)** to enhance scalability are highly valued.
- If you encounter any specific issues during the development process, feel free to join our communities, and we will guide you to the right resources.
